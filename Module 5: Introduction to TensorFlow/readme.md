# Module Title: Module 5: Introduction to TensorFlow

## Module Description
This module introduces TensorFlow, a powerful library for building and training deep learning models. 

### Module Summary
This module will cover the basics of TensorFlow, including tensors, variables, operations, building and training neural networks, and saving/loading models. 

## Topics

### Topic 1: Introduction to TensorFlow: Tensors, Variables, Operations
**Description**: This section introduces the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow, including tensors (multidimensional arrays), variables (modifiable tensors), and operations (mathematical computations on tensors). 

**Summary**:
Learn about tensors, variables, and operations in TensorFlow.

**Details**:
Students will learn how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on tensors using TensorFlow's Python API. This includes understanding different tensor data types, shapes, and ranks. Additionally, they will learn about variables, which are used to store and update model parameters during training. 

### Topic 2: Building Neural Networks with TensorFlow: Layers, Activation Functions
**Description**: This section covers the construction of neural networks in TensorFlow using layers, which are reusable building blocks for creating complex models.  

**Summary**:
Understand how to build neural networks using layers and activation functions in TensorFlow. 

**Details**:
Students will learn about different types of layers (dense, convolutional, recurrent, etc.) and their roles in neural networks. Additionally, they will be introduced to activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, softmax), which introduce non-linearity into the network and enable it to learn complex patterns.

### Topic 3: Training Neural Networks: Optimizers, Loss Functions, Backpropagation
**Description**: This section focuses on the process of training neural networks, including the concepts of optimizers, loss functions, and backpropagation.

**Summary**:
Learn about training neural networks, including optimizers, loss functions, and backpropagation. 

**Details**:
Students will explore different optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, Adam) used to update model parameters during training. They will also learn about loss functions (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy), which measure the difference between predicted and actual values, guiding the optimization process. Finally, the concept of backpropagation, the algorithm used to calculate gradients and update model weights, will be explained.

### Topic 4: Saving and Loading Models
**Description**: This section covers the essential task of saving and loading trained TensorFlow models, ensuring that the trained models can be reused and deployed.

**Summary**:
Learn how to save and load trained TensorFlow models.

**Details**:
Students will learn the importance of saving trained models to disk, allowing them to reuse models without retraining. They will also learn how to load saved models from disk, restoring the model's architecture, weights, and training state. This enables them to continue training from where they left off or deploy models for inference.
