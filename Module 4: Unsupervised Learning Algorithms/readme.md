# Module Title: Module 4: Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

## Module Description
This module introduces key unsupervised learning techniques for pattern discovery and data clustering.

### Module Summary
This module will cover unsupervised learning algorithms, including clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. Students will learn the concepts, algorithms, and applications of these methods, gaining practical experience in implementing and evaluating them using Python libraries like Scikit-learn.

## Topics

### Topic 1: Clustering Algorithms
**Description**: Learn about different clustering algorithms and their applications.

**Summary**:
Clustering is a technique to group similar data points together. This topic covers different clustering methods and their use cases.

**Details**:
We will cover K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. We will discuss how these algorithms work, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to evaluate their performance. We will also explore practical applications of clustering in various domains.

### Topic 2: Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
**Description**: Understand Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing data dimensionality.

**Summary**:
PCA is a technique to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information. This topic covers the principles and application of PCA.

**Details**:
This topic will introduce the concept of dimensionality reduction and its importance in machine learning. We will delve into PCA, a powerful technique for feature extraction and data visualization. Students will learn how to implement PCA using Scikit-learn and interpret its results.

### Topic 3: Association Rule Mining
**Description**: Discover hidden patterns and relationships in data using association rule mining.

**Summary**:
Association rule mining finds interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. This topic covers the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining.

**Details**:
We will explore the Apriori algorithm, a popular method for association rule mining. Students will learn how to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional data. We will also discuss applications of association rule mining in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.
