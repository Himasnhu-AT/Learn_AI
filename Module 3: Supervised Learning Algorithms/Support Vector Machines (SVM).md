# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the core concepts of SVMs and explore their practical applications using Python's Scikit-learn library.

## Understanding the Basics

At its heart, SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points belonging to different classes.  Let's break down the key elements:

* **Hyperplane:** Imagine a line in a 2D space or a plane in a 3D space. In higher dimensions, this becomes a hyperplane. It's the decision boundary that classifies data points.
* **Support Vectors:** These are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. They play a crucial role in determining the optimal hyperplane's position.
* **Margin:** The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points (support vectors) is called the margin. The goal of SVM is to maximize this margin.

## Why Maximize the Margin?

Maximizing the margin leads to better generalization and robustness. A wider margin implies that the classifier is less sensitive to small variations in the data.  This helps the model perform well on unseen data.

## Linearly Separable Data

Let's consider a scenario where data points from two classes can be perfectly separated by a straight line (hyperplane).

**Example:**

Imagine you have data points representing "cats" and "dogs" in a 2D space.  A line can be drawn to perfectly separate the two groups. This is a simple example of linearly separable data.

**Code Example (using Scikit-learn):**

Sample Python Code: 

```{language}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate some linearly separable data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=50, centers=2, random_state=0)

# Create an SVM classifier
svm = SVC(kernel='linear') 

# Train the model
svm.fit(X, y)

# Plot the decision boundary
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y)
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('Linearly Separable Data with SVM Decision Boundary')

# Create a grid of points for plotting the decision boundary
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1, 0.01),
                     np.arange(X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1, 0.01))
Z = svm.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
plt.contour(xx, yy, Z, colors='k', linestyles='--')

plt.show()
```

## Non-Linearly Separable Data

In real-world scenarios, data is often complex and not linearly separable.  Here's where kernel functions come into play.

### Kernel Trick

The kernel trick is a powerful technique that allows us to implicitly map data into a higher-dimensional space where it might become linearly separable.  Think of it as bending and twisting the original data space so that a hyperplane can separate the classes more effectively.

### Common Kernel Functions

* **Linear Kernel:** This is the simplest kernel and assumes linear separability. It's suitable for cases where data is already well-separated.
* **Polynomial Kernel:** This allows for non-linear decision boundaries by mapping data into a higher-dimensional space using polynomial functions.
* **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel:**  A popular choice due to its flexibility. It uses a Gaussian function to calculate similarity between data points.
* **Sigmoid Kernel:** Inspired by neural networks, the sigmoid kernel can create non-linear decision boundaries.

**Example:**

Let's imagine you have data that forms a circle, where one class lies inside the circle and the other outside.  A linear hyperplane wouldn't be able to separate these classes effectively.  However, using a kernel like RBF, we can implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional space where a hyperplane can classify the data accurately.

**Code Example (using Scikit-learn):**

Sample Python Code: 

```{language}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_circles

# Generate non-linearly separable data
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=200, factor=0.5, noise=0.05)

# Create an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf') 

# Train the model
svm.fit(X, y)

# Plot the decision boundary
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y)
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('Non-Linearly Separable Data with SVM Decision Boundary (RBF Kernel)')

# Create a grid of points for plotting the decision boundary
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1, 0.01),
                     np.arange(X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1, 0.01))
Z = svm.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
plt.contour(xx, yy, Z, colors='k', linestyles='--')

plt.show()
```

## Choosing the Right Kernel

The choice of kernel depends on the nature of your data and the complexity of the decision boundary.

* **Linear Kernel:** Suitable for linearly separable data or when computational efficiency is a priority.
* **Polynomial Kernel:** Useful for capturing polynomial relationships in the data.
* **RBF Kernel:** A good default choice for many problems, but requires tuning the gamma parameter.
* **Sigmoid Kernel:**  Can be effective in some cases but may require careful hyperparameter tuning.

## Regularization (C Parameter)

The regularization parameter `C` controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.

* **High C:** Enforces a smaller margin but allows for more misclassifications.
* **Low C:**  Maximizes the margin but can be more sensitive to outliers.

## Assignment

1. **Linear SVM:**
   * Load the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
   * Use a linear SVM to classify the iris species.
   * Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Visualize the decision boundaries for two features.

2. **Non-Linear SVM:**
   * Generate a synthetic dataset using `make_moons` from Scikit-learn.
   * Train an SVM with an RBF kernel.
   * Experiment with different values of `gamma` (the RBF kernel parameter) and observe the impact on the decision boundary.
   * Plot the decision boundaries for different `gamma` values.

3. **SVM for Image Classification:**
   * Explore a real-world application of SVM. Choose a dataset of images for a binary classification problem (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
   * Preprocess the images (resize, convert to grayscale, extract features).
   * Use an SVM classifier with a suitable kernel.
   * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
