## Topics

### Topic 1: Linear Regression
**Description**: Learn the fundamentals of linear regression, a foundational supervised learning algorithm for predicting continuous targets.

**Summary**:
Linear regression is widely used for predicting numerical values, such as stock prices or sales figures, based on historical data. 

**Details**:
We will explore simple and multiple linear regression, understand the underlying assumptions, and learn how to interpret model coefficients. We'll cover techniques for model fitting, feature selection, and handling overfitting. Practical examples using Scikit-learn will be provided.

### Topic 2: Logistic Regression
