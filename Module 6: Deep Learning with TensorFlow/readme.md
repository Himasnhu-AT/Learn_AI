## Module Description
This module delves into the exciting world of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers. We'll be using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.

### Module Summary
This module covers the architecture and applications of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing long-term dependencies in data. We will implement these models using TensorFlow and explore real-world applications in computer vision and natural language processing.
